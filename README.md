# Overview
This is an Animal Dictionary cloud database software. The user can query the database to get all animal names contained inside the DB. You can also get a random animal name and fact about that animal whenever you want. The idea behind the database is to soon be intregrated into a phone application to be used for elementary learning. This will teach kids some basic fun facts about various animals. 

This was also intended to help me learn how to interface with cloud databases and be more knowledgeable about andriod apps and how various things use cloud databases.

# Cloud Database
I used google Firebase. I created a really simple database of about 200 animals. Each of those animals has anywhere from 5-20 cool little facts that people might not know about the animals. There will be some upgrades for pictures in the future.

# Development Environment
I used VS code as my text editor. 
I used Google Firebase to store the data of all the animals which required me to get firebasae-admin installed

# Useful Websites
These websites were really helpful in getting this small software developed.
* [Firebase Docs](hhttps://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/query-data/get-data)
* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)

# Future Work

* Needs to be converted over to JAVA for further use in the future app
* Needs to handle the underscores before some of the animal names
* Needs to have a checker for the user input to make they dont input any wrong or invalid characters.
